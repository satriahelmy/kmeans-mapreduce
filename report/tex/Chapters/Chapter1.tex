The first task is to install hadoop in your local machine. We chose to install Cloudera distribution (which includes hadoop) in order to implement k-means algorithm. For this purpose, you first need to download \textbf{Oracle Virtual box} [11] based on your operating system and \textbf{Cloudera Quickstart VM} [12].\\
When everything is installed, you need to create a Virtual Machine with Linux operating system and version ad Ubuntu 64 bit in your VB. After that, set up the newly created VM with cloudera-quickstart-vm-5.13.0-0-virtualbox.ovf
file.
